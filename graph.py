Problem: I want to find a book seller
Solution: Ask to my friends if they sell it, if not -> then ask to the friends of my friends and so on

Abstraction: MyFriends = [Bob, Carl, John], John_Friends = [Linda, Carol]... each of my friends have more friends, and each of their friend's friends 
have even more friends.
So I'm basically asking to everyone that has a connection with someone that I know.

To this, I will use GRAPHS, which is information (ordered or unordered) represented by EDGES and VERTICES.
Each vertice is someone/something and the edges make the connection between the vertices. In our case,
a vertice will be a person, and the connection(edge) means that they are friends.
Example: John----Linda. John and Linda are vertices connected by an edge, which means that they are friends

Besides finding a seller, I want to find the closest one. So buying from my friend is better than buying from my friend's friend

(I highly recommend you to look for graph images in order to better understand)
